"""
Python script that helps to clean the file containing the Bash history
commands.

Note: Requires Python 3.6+

It will remove any line matching a specified regular expression and can also
remove any line starting with an alias.

Description of available settings in `settings.json`:

    "home_directory":   Absolute path to user's home directory.

    "history_file":     Name of file where the history will be cleaned up.

    "aliases_file":     Name of file where Bash aliases are set up.

    "ignore_patterns":  List of patterns to ignore in `history_file`.
                        Each line where a pattern is found will be deleted.
                            â†’ Patterns are specified as regular expressions.

    "add_aliases":      Boolean. If set to `true`, aliases from `aliases_file`
                        will be added to `ignore_patterns`.

    "aliases_match_greedily":
                        Boolean. If set to `true`, any line in `history_file`
                        starting with an alias in `aliases_file` will be
                        deleted. If set to `false`, delete line if the alias is
                        the content of the whole line (with optional space at
                        the end): `false` matches "^alias$" or "^alias $" only.

    "backup_history":   Boolean. If set to `true`, `history_file` will be
                        backed up in the same directory with a name ending in
                        .bak based on the current date.

    "delete_logs_without_confirming":
                        Boolean. If set to `true`, script with flag `-c` will
                        automatically delete all the backup files found for
                        `history_file`.

    "remove_all_duplicated_lines":
                        Boolean. If set to `true`, any following line that is
                        found to already be present in the file will be
                        removed. This setting has precedence over
                        `remove_duplicates_within_X_lines` and
                        `remove_consecutive_duplicates` (they won't be
                        executed).

    "remove_duplicates_within_X_lines":
                        Integer. Scan lines one by one. If the current line is
                        found in the next `X` lines defined by this setting, it
                        will be removed. If set to a value greater than `1`,
                        this setting has precedence over
                        `remove_consecutive_duplicates` (it won't be executed).

    "remove_consecutive_duplicates":
                        Boolean. If set to `true`, duplicated lines will be
                        deleted when they are consecutive in order to leave
                        only one match.
